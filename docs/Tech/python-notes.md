# Python Notes

#### Variables and Simple Data Types

* string - series of characters, anything inside of quotes is considered a string
* method - an action that Python can perform on a piece of data
  * every method is followed by a set of (), methods often need more info in those ()
    * title()
      * `print(name.title())`
    * upper()
      * `print(name.upper())`
    * lower()
      * `print(name.lower())`
      * useful for string data, often you will want all lower case

#### Combining or Concatenating Strings
* often useful to combine strings, ex. combining first and last names
  * ```
      first_name = "duke"
      last_name = "nukem"
      full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
      print(full_name)
    ```

#### Adding Whitespace to Strings with Tabs or Newlines
* \n - newline
  * ```
    >>> print("python")
    >>> python
    ```
* \t - tab
  * ```
    >>> print("\tpython"
    >>>     python
    ```
#### Stripping Whitespace
* rstrip() - strips whitespace to the right
* lstrip() - strips whitespace to the left
* strip() - strips whitespace from both sides

#### Avoiding Type Errors with the str() Function
* Often you will want to use a variables value within a message. eg.
* ```
  age = 23
  message = "Happy " + age + "rd Birthday!"
  print(message)
  ```
  * this will return the following error becuase Python doesn't know what to do with that data
  * ```
    Traceback (most recent call last):
     File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str
    ```
  * to solve this you have to convert the int to a str
    * ```
      age = 23
      message = "Happy " + str(age) + "rd Birthday!"
      print(message)
      ```

#### Lists
* methods for working with lists
  * .insert()
  * .append()
  * .pop()
  * del
  * .remove()
* list - collection of items in a particular order
* [] indicate a list
* lists are ordered collections, you can access any item in a list by telling python the location, or _index_
  * `print(bicycles[0].title())`
* to access the last element in a list, you would use [-1]
  * `print(bicycles[-1])`
* add elements to a list with .append() and .insert()
  * append adds to the end, insert asks for a position
    * `motorcycles.insert(0, 'ducati')`
* delete items from a list with del
  * `del motorcycles[-1]`

#### Looping
* range() - used to generate a series of numbers
  * ```
    for value in range(1,5):
        print(value)
    ```
* find minimum, maximum, and sum of a list of numbers
  * min()
  * max()
  * sum()
* list comprehension
 * allows you to generate a list in one line of code, combines for loop and creation
  * `squares = [value*2 for value in range(1,11)]`

#### Dictionaires
* a dictionary is a collection of *key-value pairs*
* each key is connected to a value and you can use a key to access the value associated with that key
* a keys value can be number, string, list, or another dictionary
* dictionary is wrapped in braces with a series of key-value pairs inside the braces
  * `alien_0 = {'color': 'green', 'points': 5}`
* to access values in a dictionary, give the name of the dictionary and place the key inside []
  * `print(alien_0['color'])`
* you can add values to dictionaries at any time
* removing key-value pairs
  * `del alien_0['points']`
* for loop with dictionaries
  * ```
    for key, value in user_0.items():
		print("\nKey: " + key)
		print("Value: " + value)
	```
  * for k, v in user_0.items() - create names for the two variables that will hold the key and value in each key-value pair
